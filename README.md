# Pomodoro

![Design preview for the Pomodoro app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out Pomodoro timer app.

Users should be able to:

- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for fonts

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
